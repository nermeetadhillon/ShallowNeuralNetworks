# ShallowNeuralNetworks

The task is to implement a 2-layer shallow neural network model to conduct a binary classification og thr teo categories in the
sign language dataset. 


# Datasets
The input size is the number of pixels in a image (64Ã—64). The size of hidden layer is determined by a hyperparameter n_h, and the size of output layer is 1.
